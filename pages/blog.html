                <strong>SCRUM explained
                </strong><br>
                <p>Let's take a look first at Scrum's founders' definition of Scrum. Ken Schwaber and  Jeff Sutherland define Scrum as "a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems." But how does it work in practice?</p>
                <p>Scrum has its roots in software development. In software development many projects are "never ending products" but not in a bad sense. It means that there are always new features to be developed or adjusted to a aspecific situation for a company's website or a digital platform for example. The Scrum team aims to generate value to its users and takes into account constant feedback from the client to make sure that the features meet the clients' and users' expectations and needs. The Scrum team consists of a Scrum Master, a Product Owner and the development team.</p>
                <p>In the next posts we are going to explain in detail which  responsibilities come along with each role.</p>

                #2 SCRUM vs. Traditional Project Management
              </button>

                <strong>SCRUM vs. Traditional Project Management
                </strong><br>
                <p>Certainly there are a lot of differences between traditional and agile Project Management but the most obvious one is that a project led under traditional Project Management generally has a fixed end date, while the Scrum team works in so-called Sprints with a goal for each sprint.</p>
                <p>The advantage of Scrum over traditional Project Management is that the Scrum team receives feedback from the client after every Sprint when new features are presented. This feedback is taken into account for future sprints and thus allows the Product Owner to  adjust the Product Backlog (project plan) to possible changes in needs and priorities of the client and users of the digital product.</p>
                <p>That's why Scrum is called agile framework.</p>

                #3 SCRUM - Why it's called framework and not method?

                <strong>SCRUM - Why it's called framework and not method?
                </strong><br>
                <p>While a method should be followed step by step, a framework is meant to be implemented to an extend that actually works for each company's situation. That means that the framework, e.g. Scrum can and should be adapted to the organization's specific situation.</p>
                <p>For example, the Scrum guide says that there should be one Scrum team per project but if the company only consists of a 5-members-team it might still be possible that the team is working on different projects at the same time. This comes along with some challenges, e.g. the Scrum metrics of the individual projects should not be mixed. Also, the required workload of each project per sprint can vary. Furthermore, the product owner probably has to handle multiple customers at the same time.</p>
                <p>Lots of challenges, but all of them can be mastered. If you have specific questions about how to deal with your specific challenges in your company, contact me and we will find a solution together!</p>
